####Summary of Activity  
    
This was my first flurry into **JavaScript** as well as introducing a new testing framework: **Jasmine**. 
   
This activity was broken down as follows: 
+ Creating a Project Directory locally, a new GitHub repo, and linking the two together.   
+ Installing Jasmine and associated files.
+ Rewriting the SpecRunner.html to look for my source and spec files. 
+ Creating a spec folder, and a javabuzz_spec file. 
+ Writing simple tests, running Jasmine to see the failed test, then writing the production code to pass them in a seperate source directory. 
+ Commiting each completed version to Github via the command line. 
    
####Lessons Learned     
   
This was a familiar exercise in an unfamiliar programming language, and was a good way to start looking at JavaScript. Although initially I felt that JS was a little more 'prickly' than Ruby, there were many more similarities than differences, and the experience wasn't at all overwhelming. 
   
Again, using Jasmine was a little different and something to get used to, but the similarities outweighed the differences from RSpec.
   
Overall, just a little exercise to break the ice with JavaScript.
